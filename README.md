# Project: Portfolio
![](screenShot.png)
#
## Description
I created an HTML file to create my portfolio. The portfolio inludes a  < nav >  bar linking to specific sections of the page. I have a header with my name included. A body with sections titled "about me", "my work", and "contact me." A photo was attached so show user's my profile. The contact me section has links to where you can contact me. Then I included a small footer. To be continued and edited in the process.

## What does the application do?

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
